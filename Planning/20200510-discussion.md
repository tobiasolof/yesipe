    - What role does the ingredient play in the recipe? (Key, base, or "kinda-not-relevant")
    - What ingredients works well together, i.e are commonly together?
    - What ingredient are replaceable and with what?

General ideas
  - SW should always "have an idea" of a recipe including picked items + next suggestion when giving suggestions


UI support possibilites
  - Was the suggestion good?
  - Is every ingredient placed in the correct class (Key, base, or "kinda-not-relevant")
